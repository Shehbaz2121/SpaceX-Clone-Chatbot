# Description

This project is a clone of the SpaceX website, built as a learning exercise to practice front-end web development skills. It includes hero sections with background images, a fixed navigation bar, and a simple chatbot that responds to user queries about SpaceX, Elon Musk, and related topics. The chatbot uses keyword-based logic for replies and maintains a chat history.

The goal was to create a visually appealing, functional website without a backend, demonstrating HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity.

# Features
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
Interactive Chatbot: Toggleable chat window with keyword-based responses, chat history, and Enter key support.
Smooth Navigation: Fixed header with links to sections (Vehicles, Launches, etc.).
SpaceX Theme: Inspired by SpaceX's aesthetic, with sections on multiplanetary life, space technology, and Starship.
Hover Effects: Buttons and links have smooth transitions for better UX.
Technologies Used
## HTML5: For structuring the webpage and content.
## CSS3: For styling, layouts, and responsiveness (including Flexbox and media queries).
## JavaScript (Vanilla): For chatbot functionality, chat toggling, and dynamic interactions.
## External Resources: Google Fonts for typography and Unsplash/SpaceX images for backgrounds.
