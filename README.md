# SpaceX-Clone-Chatbot
As a learning exercise in web development, this project recreates a SpaceX-themed website from scratch. It showcases HTML for structure, CSS for styling (including responsive layouts and hover effects), and vanilla JavaScript for dynamic features like a toggleable chatbot. The chatbot uses keyword to provide replies on topics like rockets, Mars.
